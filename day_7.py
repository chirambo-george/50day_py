# Day 7: A String Range
# Write a function called string_range that takes a single
# number and returns a string of its range. The string characters
# should be separated by dots(.) For example, if you pass 6 as
# an argument, your function should return â€˜0.1.2.3.4.5â€™.

a = int(input("Enter Number: "))
a = a -1
while a >= 0:
    
    print(f"{a}", end=".")
    a = a - 1

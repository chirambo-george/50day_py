# Day 11: Are They Equal?
# Write a function called equal_strings. The function takes two
# strings as arguments and compares them. If the strings are equal
# (if they have the same characters and have equal length), it
# should return True, if they are not, it should return False. For
# example, ‘love’ and ‘evol’ should return True.

def equal_strings(str1, str2):
    pass


a = input("Enter String: ")
b = input("Enter String: ")

if a == b:
    print("Equal")
    
else:
    print("Not Equal")

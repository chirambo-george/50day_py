# Day 6: User Name Generator
# Write a function called user_name that generates a username
# from the user’s email. The code should ask the user to input an
# email and the code should return everything before the @ sign
# as their user name. For example, if someone enters
# ben@gmail.com, the code should return ben as their user
# name.


def user_name():
    
    email = input("Enter your email: ")
    
    user_name = email.split('@')[0]
    
    print(f"Your user name is -> {user_name}")
    
user_name()

# Day 9: Biggest Odd Number
# Create a function called biggest_odd that takes a string of
# numbers and returns the biggest odd number in the list. For
# example, if you pass ‘23569’ as an argument, your function
# should return 9. Use list comprehension.
import math
# a = 9
# if a%2 != 0:
    
#     print("odd Number")
    
# else:
#     print("LOST ")


a = '47538'
print(a.split(sep=''))
